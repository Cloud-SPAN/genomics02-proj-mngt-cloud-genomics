# Genomics Session 1. Project management for cloud genomics

First session of the Cloud-SPAN Genomics course.

Cloud-SPAN is a collaboration between the [Department of Biology, University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) and [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award (Project Reference: [MR/V038680/1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgtr.ukri.org%2Fprojects%3Fref%3DMR%252FV038680%252F1&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF0nsozFp-1kvcp0Dgjks6kY8CiCQ)) which trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing infrastructure
The course is based on the Data Carpentry’s [Genomics Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop), streamlined and extended to serve as the foundation course for the Cloud-SPAN advanced modules. The edited material is not endorsed by [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) or the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) in general.
